## 🔢 Contribution Calculation
- **📊 Basis**: Contribution points are calculated based on the technologies associated with each issue and your level of contribution.
- **🔖 Issue Tags**: Technologies associated with an issue are identified in GitHub issue tags, assigned by the repository maintainer.

### 🌐 Example
- If an issue is tagged as "4X.liquid, 4Xshopify, 1X.js, 1Xvue":
  - For each point that issue carries, it is divided among the associated technologies.
  - 0.4 points are added to each .liquid and Shopify, 0.1 points to each .js and Vue.

### 🛠️ Technology Association
- Tags like 'shopify-theme' can be broken down into associated technologies based on associated rates, e.g., 0.25 points for .js, 0.25 for .css, and 0.3 for .liquid.
